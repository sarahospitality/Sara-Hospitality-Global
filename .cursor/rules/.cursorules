  When implementing instructions provided in chat, the AI agent must follow these rules : 

  1. Requirement Understanding & Planning
     - Carefully read and understand the request.
     - Create a short plan or summary of how the change will be implemented.
     - Share the plan and obtain approval before making any changes.

  2. Minimal Impact Policy
     - Modify only what is necessary to fulfill the request.
     - Do not change or break unrelated functionality.
     - If a change could impact other functionality, highlight this risk, review it, and get explicit approval before proceeding.

  3. Validation & Verification
     - After implementing, immediately test and verify the change.
     - Confirm the requested feature works as intended.
     - Ensure no other functionality is unintentionally affected.

  4. Clarification Before Action
     - If the request is unclear, ambiguous, or could have multiple interpretations, ask questions and get clarification before starting implementation.

  5. Code Quality & Standards
     - Follow best practices for readability, maintainability, and security.
     - Add clear comments for complex logic.
     - Keep changes small and scoped to the request.

  6. Testing Requirements
     - Write or update relevant unit tests and integration tests for the implemented change.
     - Ensure all existing tests pass before marking the change complete.

  7. Error Handling & Logging
     - Implement proper error handling where needed.
     - Add meaningful logging for debugging without exposing sensitive data.

  8. Documentation Updates
     - Update related documentation, comments, or README if the change introduces new behavior, dependencies, or usage instructions.
