<section id="durability">
<h2>Step 8: Durability and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Hotel furniture must withstand intensive daily use:</p>

<h3>Commercial vs. Residential Grade</h3>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Residential Grade</th>
<th>Commercial Grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fabric Durability</td>
<td>15,000-20,000 double rubs</td>

</section>

<section id="budget-roi">
<h2>Step 9: Budget and ROI Considerations</h2>
<p>Smart budgeting ensures you get maximum value from your furniture investment:</p>

<h3>Calculate Total Cost of Ownership</h3>
<p>Look beyond initial purchase price:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> Initial furniture investment</li>
<li><strong>Delivery & Installation:</strong> 10-15% of furniture cost</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Annual cleaning, repairs (2-3% of value)</li>
<li><strong>Replacement:</strong> Cost divided by expected lifespan</li>
<li><strong>Lost Revenue:</strong> Poor quality furniture = negative reviews = fewer bookings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Value Equation Example</h3>
<p>Compare two furniture options for a 100-room hotel:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Factor</th>
<th>Budget Option</th>
<th>Quality Option</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost per Room</td>
<td>$3,000</td>
<td>$6,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total Investment</td>
<td>$300,000</td>
<td>$600,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expected Lifespan</td>
<td>7 years</td>
<td>15 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Annual Cost</td>
<td>$42,857</td>
<td>$40,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maintenance/Year</td>
<td>$12,000</td>
<td>$9,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total Annual Cost</td>
<td>$54,857</td>
<td>$49,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The "expensive" option actually costs less annually and delivers better guest satisfaction!</p>

<h3>Where to Invest More</h3>
<p>Prioritize your budget on high-impact items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Priority:</strong> Beds and mattresses (guest satisfaction driver)</li>
<li><strong>High Priority:</strong> Lobby furniture, dining seating (first impressions)</li>
<li><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Guest room case goods, desk chairs</li>
<li><strong>Lower Priority:</strong> Decorative accents, occasional tables</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost-Saving Strategies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Sizes:</strong> Custom dimensions increase costs 20-30%</li>
<li><strong>Volume Orders:</strong> Bulk purchases often include discounts</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Designs:</strong> Less ornate furniture costs less</li>
<li><strong>Mixed Materials:</strong> Combine solid wood fronts with engineered bodies</li>
