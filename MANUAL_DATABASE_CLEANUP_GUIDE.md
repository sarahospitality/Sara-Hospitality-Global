## üöÄ Automated Solution (Run Script)

### If you want to automate this:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the cleanup script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/clean-blog-content.js
   ```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Connect to your Supabase database
- ‚úÖ Find all blog posts
- ‚úÖ Remove the unwanted text patterns
- ‚úÖ Update the database automatically

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backup First**: Before running the script, export your blog_posts table as backup
2. **Test Mode**: The script shows what it will do before making changes
3. **Safe**: Only removes the specific text patterns, nothing else

## üîç SQL Alternative (Advanced)

If you prefer SQL, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Blog 1: How to Choose Hotel Furniture?
UPDATE blog_posts 
SET content = REPLACE(content, 'How to Choose Hotel Furniture
Updated October 17, 2025 by Sara Global Hospitality', '')
WHERE title ILIKE '%How to Choose Hotel Furniture%';

-- Blog 2: Hotel Furniture Buying Tips for Beginners
UPDATE blog_posts 
SET content = REPLACE(content, 'Hotel Furniture Buying Tips for Beginners
Updated October 17, 2025 by Sara Global Hospitality', '')
WHERE title ILIKE '%Hotel Furniture Buying Tips%';

-- Blog 3: Why Choose Sara Global Hospitality
UPDATE blog_posts 
SET content = REPLACE(content, 'Published by Sara Global Hospitality

Why Choose Sara Global Hospitality for Your Hotel Furniture', '')
WHERE title ILIKE '%Why Choose Sara Global%';

-- General cleanup for any remaining instances
UPDATE blog_posts 
SET content = REPLACE(content, 'Updated October 17, 2025 by Sara Global Hospitality', '');

UPDATE blog_posts 
SET content = REPLACE(content, 'Published by Sara Global Hospitality', '');
```
