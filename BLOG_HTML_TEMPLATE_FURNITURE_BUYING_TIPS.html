<h2>Step 2: Set a Realistic Budget</h2>
<p>Understanding true costs helps prevent overspending and ensures you get the best value for your investment.</p>

<h3>Budget Allocation Guidelines</h3>
<p>Here's how to distribute your furniture budget effectively:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Accessories & Finishing:</strong> 5-10% of budget (artwork, mirrors, decor)</li>
<li><strong>Contingency:</strong> 10% buffer for unexpected needs or changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Per-Room Budget Benchmarks</h3>
<p>Average furniture costs per guest room (2024 estimates):</p>

<section id="quality-over-price">
<h2>Step 3: Prioritize Quality Over Initial Price</h2>
<p>The cheapest option often becomes the most expensive in the long run. Here's how to evaluate true quality:</p>

<h3>Construction Quality Indicators</h3>
<p>Look for these signs of well-built furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid Joinery:</strong> Dovetail or mortise-and-tenon joints (not just glue or staples)</li>
<li><strong>Quality Hardware:</strong> Full-extension soft-close drawer slides, commercial-grade hinges</li>
<li><strong>Proper Finishes:</strong> Multiple finish coats with UV protection and sealant</li>
<li><strong>Sturdy Frames:</strong> Kiln-dried hardwood or reinforced engineered wood frames</li>
<li><strong>Edge Banding:</strong> High-quality edge banding that won't peel or chip</li>
<li><strong>Weight:</strong> Quality furniture feels substantial (cheap materials feel flimsy)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Material Comparison</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Material</th>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>
<th>Best For</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Solid Hardwood</td>
<td>Extremely durable, refinishable, premium look</td>
<td>Higher cost, heavier weight</td>
<td>Luxury properties, high-traffic areas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engineered Wood</td>
<td>Cost-effective, stable, consistent quality</td>
<td>Cannot be refinished multiple times</td>
<td>Mid-range hotels, most applications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Laminate</td>
<td>Very affordable, easy to clean, modern look</td>
<td>Can chip, not refinishable</td>
<td>Budget properties, low-moisture areas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metal Frames</td>
<td>Very durable, modern aesthetic, easy maintenance</td>
<td>Can feel cold, limited styles</td>
<td>Contemporary hotels, outdoor furniture</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Testing Furniture Quality</h3>
<p>Before committing to large orders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request Samples:</strong> Get physical samples to inspect construction</li>
<li><strong>Sit and Test:</strong> Actually use the furniture - open drawers, sit on chairs</li>
<li><strong>Check Weight Limits:</strong> Ensure furniture can handle real-world use</li>
<li><strong>Examine Finishes:</strong> Look for smooth, even application without drips or rough spots</li>
<li><strong>Test Mechanisms:</strong> Operate drawer slides, hinges, and moving parts repeatedly</li>
</ul>

<section id="common-mistakes">
<h2>Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>
<p>Learn from others' errors to save time, money, and frustration:</p>

<h3>Mistake #1: Choosing Based on Price Alone</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Cheap furniture wears out quickly, requiring early replacement and damaging guest experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Calculate total cost of ownership including replacement frequency, maintenance, and guest satisfaction impact.</p>

<h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring Maintenance Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Beautiful furniture that requires constant upkeep becomes a staff burden and cost drain.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Choose materials and finishes appropriate for your maintenance capabilities and staffing levels.</p>

<h3>Mistake #3: Not Testing Furniture First</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Ordering hundreds of pieces based on photos alone can lead to massive disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Always request and thoroughly test samples before placing large orders.</p>

<h3>Mistake #4: Overlooking Ergonomics and Comfort</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Furniture that looks great but feels uncomfortable leads to negative guest reviews.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Prioritize guest comfort alongside aesthetics - actually test seating and beds yourself.</p>

<h3>Mistake #5: Failing to Consider Future Needs</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Buying just enough for today without considering expansion or replacement pieces.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Order extra units for future rooms or keep good records of specifications for matching orders later.</p>

<h3>Mistake #6: Ignoring Assembly and Installation</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Complex furniture arrives with no installation plan or qualified installers available.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Clarify installation requirements upfront and budget for professional installation if needed.</p>

<h3>Mistake #7: Not Reading the Fine Print</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Warranty exclusions, shipping limitations, or return policies create unexpected costs.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Carefully review all contracts, warranties, and terms before signing.</p>
