# Database Blog Status Check

## Issue: Only 2 of 4 Grid Blogs Showing

### Current Grid Configuration:
1. ❌ `why-choose-sara-global-hospitality-hotel-furniture` - **NOT in database**
2. ❌ `hotel-furniture-buying-tips-beginners` - **NOT in database**
3. ✅ `how-to-choose-right-hotel-casegoods-manufacturer-partner` - **EXISTS (showing)**
4. ✅ `the-guide-to-modern-hospitality-outdoor-furniture-for-hotels-resorts` - **EXISTS (showing)**

### Why Only 2 Are Showing:
The first 2 blogs are **HTML templates only** - they exist as files but **not in your Supabase database** yet.

---

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Add Your 3 New Blogs to Database (Recommended)
You need to insert your 3 new blog HTML templates into Supabase:

1. **"Why Choose Sara Global Hospitality for your Hotel Furniture?"**
   - File: `BLOG_HTML_TEMPLATE_WHY_CHOOSE_SARA.html`
   - Image: `/blog/outdoor furniture for hotels/how-to-choose-hotel-furniture.webp`
   
2. **"Hotel Furniture Buying Tips for Beginners"**
   - File: `BLOG_HTML_TEMPLATE_FURNITURE_BUYING_TIPS.html`
   - Image: `/blog/outdoor furniture for hotels/furniture-buying-tips.webp`

3. **"How to Choose Hotel Furniture?"** (if you want it in the grid too)
   - File: `BLOG_HTML_TEMPLATE_HOW_TO_CHOOSE_FURNITURE.html`
   - Image: `/blog/outdoor furniture for hotels/hotel-furniture.webp`

**How to Add:**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → `blog_posts`
- Insert new rows with the content from HTML template files
- Use the SQL templates in `BLOG_NEW_POSTS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

### Option 2: Use Existing Database Blogs (Temporary Fix)
Update the HomePage to use blogs that **already exist** in your database.

## Recommendation:

**Please confirm:** Have you added the 3 new blog posts to your Supabase database yet?

- [ ] Yes, I've added them to the database
- [ ] No, I haven't added them yet - please use existing blogs for now
- [ ] I need help adding them to the database
